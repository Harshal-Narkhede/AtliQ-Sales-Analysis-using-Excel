# AtliQ-Sales-Analysis-using-Excel
AtliQ is a hardware powerhouse, supplying PCs, mice, printers, and more to a diverse customer base. They cater to both traditional brick-and-mortar stores like Croma and Best Buy, as well as online giants like Amazon and Flipkart. To gain valuable insights and make strategic decisions, AtliQ has tasked its business users with analyzing a massive dataset exceeding 1.5 million records. This analysis will be used to build comprehensive sales and financial reports, painting a clear picture of AtliQ's performance.

# Steps in making the reports

1. Clean Up:
Loaded all the data files (CSVs) into Power Query.
Fixed any typos or missing information in the data.
Removed any duplicate entries.
Made sure each category table had a unique identifier (like a special ID number).

2. Connect Everything:
Linked all the data tables together, like building with Legos. This helps see how things are related (e.g., sales figures and product types).
Created a new "date table" using Power Query to separate dates into year, month, and day for easier analysis.
Added a special column to track finances based on AtliQ's unique fiscal year (September to August) and connected it to the other tables.

3. Ask Questions:
Used PivotTables to explore the data and ask questions like "What were our top sellers last year?"
Created calculations (measures) to understand important things like profit margins (gross margin %) and cost of goods sold (COGS) for different time periods.

4. Make it Clear:
Used colors and formatting to highlight important findings in the data, like which products were selling well or poorly. This made it easier to see what mattered most.
